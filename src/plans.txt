in initial state make 2 arrays (1 for fetching data on the first page, 2 - on the second) and 2 pages (the same principle);
to know pages count add - total count / limit and round it to the bigger integer;
to set page use created action;
initial pages array by the loop;
add current page variable;
find the index of current page in the pages array;
depending on this index make logic of showing prev, page number, next button;
check if index of current value is more then 0 (then show the prev button) and if it is smaller then array.length - 1 (then show the next button);
on click of every button change current page to page number -1 / page number / page number + 1;
somehow fetch data if it is less then limit??;

----------------------------------------------

in json file for each product add rating and longer description;
in product page add loop for drawing the stars for rating;
make the related products section on the product page;
start making comparison page;
for that make another value in initial state that would be an array of cards that are compared;
it should not be higher then 3;
